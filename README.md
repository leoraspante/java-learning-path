# Java Learning Path

This repository is my personal space to practice and explore Java.  
Here I collect code examples, exercises, and small projects that reflect my learning journey — from the basics of the language to object-oriented programming and frameworks like Spring Boot.  

The goal is simple: keep track of progress, experiment with ideas, and build a solid foundation in Java development.
